//Algorirthm for multiples of a number
step1-start
step2-declare variables num,S and count,i
step3-read the value into num,S and count=1(for example num=3,S=15)
step4-first we need to check whether count is less than or equal to S or not.
step5-if it is true then calculate i=num*count
step6-print i value
step7-otherwise increment the count value and repeat the step 4,5,6 until the count is less than or equal to S i.e.,(count<=15)
step8-stop
