//Perfect Number
step1-start
step2-declare num,count,sum
step3-read num(12) value,count=1,sum=0
step4-check whether count is less than num if it is true then go to step5 otherwise go to step12
step5-check whether the num is divisible by count or not(num%count==0) if it is true then go to step step6
step6-add sum,count value and store the result in sum(sum=sum+count)
step7-increment count value by 1(count=count+1) until the count less than num(count<num)
step8-repeat step 4 until count less than or equal to num
step9-check whether the sum is equal to num or not(sum==num) if it is true then go to step10 otherwise go to step11
step10-print num is perfect number
step11-print num is not a perfect number
step12-stop
