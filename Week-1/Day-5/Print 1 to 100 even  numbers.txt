//Print Even numbers 1-100
step1-start
step2-declare count
step3-assign value 1 to count i.e., count=1
step4-check whether count is divisible by 2 or not i.e., (count%2==0)
step5-if it is true print count
step6-increment count value by one and store the value in count(count=count+1)
step7-repeat step 4,5&6 until it reaches count value is less than or equal to 100(count<=100)
